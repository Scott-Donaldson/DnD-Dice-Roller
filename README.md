There is not much to this, just didnt fancy buying my own dice for Dungeons and Dragons. Wrote a c# GUI Script to handle it
Figured other people might want to use it as well, it isnt aesthetic or anything, just a simple Gui with 2 inputs for sides and rolls and 1 output
to display what they landed on. Go to the releases section or just click the link above to go directly to it.
